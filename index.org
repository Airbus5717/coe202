** Introduction
- computers represent data in binary numbers (1 and 0)
- all data must be represented in binary format
- data could be numbers, alphanumeric characters, images, sounds and many more.
- in general they are (numbers and characters)

** Numbering Systems
- Numbering systems are characterized by their base number (also called radix or r for short)
- a number with base n will have digits from 0 to (n-1)
- for example base 2 includes : 0 and 1
- the widely used numbering systems are:
   | Numbering system | Base | digits set         |
   |------------------+------+--------------------|
   | Binary           |    2 | 0, 1               |
   | Octal            |    8 | 0, ..., 7          |
   | Decimal          |   10 | 0, 1, ..., 9       |
   | Hexadecimal      |   16 | 0, ... 9, A, ... F |
