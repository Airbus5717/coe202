* Data Representation
*** Suwaiyan slides
- [[./res/01-NumberSystems-su.pdf][click here]]

** Introduction
- computers represent data in binary numbers (1 and 0)
- all data must be represented in binary format
- data could be numbers, alphanumeric characters, images, sounds and many more.
- in general they are (numbers and characters)

-----
** Numbering Systems
- Numbering systems are characterized by their base number (also called radix or r for short)
- a number with base n will have digits from 0 to (n-1)
- for example base 2 includes : 0 and 1
- the widely used numbering systems are:
   | Numbering system | Base | digits set         |
   |------------------+------+--------------------|
   | Binary           |    2 | 0, 1               |
   | Octal            |    8 | 0, ..., 7          |
   | Decimal          |   10 | 0, 1, ..., 9       |
   | Hexadecimal      |   16 | 0, ... 9, A, ... F |

-----
** Weighted Number Systems
 - a number =D= consists of =n= digits with each digit having a particular position.
 - Every Digit has a fixed weight

 [[./res/unit1-wns.png]] (from el-maleh slides)

 - for example in base 10: =10 = 1 * 10 + 0 * 10=
-----
** The Radix (=Base=)
the allowed set of digits are from =0= to =r-1=
for example in base 8: =0...7=
- revise the (El-Maleh's) slides (7-12)
-----
*** Digit weight
example a number in base 8: =34556=
- the most significant digit (MSD) is : =3=
- the least significant digit (LSD) is : =6=
-----
** Binary System
- the r = =2=
- each digit is either 1 or 0
- each bit represents a power of 2
 |  2^n | Decimal value |
 |------+---------------|
 |  2^0 |             1 |
 |  2^1 |             2 |
 |  2^2 |             4 |
 |  2^3 |             8 |
 |  2^4 |            16 |
 |  2^5 |            32 |
 |  2^6 |            64 |
 |  2^7 |           128 |
 |  2^8 |           256 |
 |  2^9 |           512 |
 | 2^10 |          1024 |
- example of conversion from binary to decimal
  binary number (101)
  = 1 * 2^2 + 0 * 2^1 + 1 * 2^0
  = 5 in decimal
- see a YouTube video on conversion from decimal to binary [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsxT4FfRBaM][click here]]
- another one on from binary to decimal [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLflTjd3lWA][click here]]

** Octal System
- r = 8
- Octal digits = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}
- conversion videos [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCM2JReWS10][click here for octal 2 decimal]] and [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayul1fmZd0Y][click here for decimal 2 octal]]

** Hexadecimal System
- r = 16
- Digits are 0..9 then A, B, C, D, E, F
- F is equavilant to 15 in decimal
- conversion videos [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJW6qnfhC70][click here for deci 2 hex]] and [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg-HEGBpCQk][click here for hex 2 deci]]
  also [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_YC6DSPpQE][click here for hex 2 binary]] and [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSLKOKGQq0Y][click here for binary 2 hex]].

** Binary coded decimal
- every number is represented as 4 bits
- there are different ways to represent it
  - BCD8421 way is like for 1: 0001 and so forth
  - XS-3 is like BCD8421 but add 3 to BCD8421
- example 103
  - BCD8421: 0001 0000 0011
  - XS-3:    0100 0011 0110

** ASCII Chars
- each number/char/symbol is represented with a number from 0 to 127
- extended ascii has to 256 numbers
- ascii table [[https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/ascii][link]]

** Error detection by parity bit
- Sender tries to send data to reciever which is encodeded in binary
- Data could get corrupted during transmission
- so basically we construct a basic error checker that would help reduce errors (but not always the case)
*** Parity Bit
- We choose an even or odd parity bit
- Even parity: number of 1s is even
  - add zero to keep the 1s even
- Odd parity: number of 1s is odd
  - add zero to keep the 1s odd

* TODO Binary Logic and Gates
*** Suwaiyan slides
- [[./res/02-BooleanAlgebra.pdf][click here]]
** Boolean Algebra
Digital circuts use binary Systems, signals can be either logic '0' or '1' corresponding to High(1) or Low(0) voltages.
- Digital Circuts take binary signals and produce binary signals
- Binary logic algebra is commonly referred to as binary algebra
- Algebric structure with
  - Booleans = {0 , 1}
  - Two Binary Operators = {., +}
    - the dot =.= represents =AND=
    - the plus sign =+= represents =OR=
  - One Unary operator = (written as a Dash above the symbol or as ='= after the symbol)
- Example =F = A.B + 1=
*** Operator precedence
1. Parethesis =( Expression )= {Highest priority}
2. =NOT= operator =Expr'=
3. =AND= operator =Expr1 . Expr2=
4. =OR= operator =Expr1 + Expr2= {Lowest priority}

*** to get a dual
- Change every =AND= to =OR= (. to +)
- Change every =OR= to =AND= (+ to .)
- Complement variables
  - change 1 to 0
  - change 0 to 1
